# python-qrcode-maker

This code allows the user to input text or a link and converts it into a QR code. 

First, it imports the `qrcode` module which provides functionality for generating QR codes. 

Then, the user is prompted to enter the text or link that they want to convert to a QR code using the `input()` function. The input is stored in the `link` variable. 

Next, a `QRCode` instance is created with some default settings, such as the error correction level, box size, and border. The data from the `link` variable is then added to the QR code instance using the `add_data()` method. 

The `make()` method is called to generate the QR code, and the resulting image is stored in the `img` variable. The QR code image is created with a black fill color and gray background color. 

Finally, the image is saved as a PNG file named `qrcode.png` using the `save()` method.
